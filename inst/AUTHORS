This software is based in part on code from the R stats package which indicated
it was released under GPL-2 or any later version of the license. This
package is then released under GPL-3 or any later version the license.

The function std_rWishart_factor() in rCholWishart.c is taken directly
from stats::rWishart.c and the *Wishart functions are alterations of the
rWishart() function in stats::rWishart.c. Those are authored by the R
Core Team.

The changes and original contributions to the functions found in
rCholWishart.c are authored by Geoffrey Thompson <gzthompson@gmail.com>
