Description: A package for fast computation of various functions related to the Wishart
    distribution, such as sampling from the Cholesky factor of the Wishart,
    sampling from the inverse Wishart, sampling from the Cholesky factor of
    the inverse Wishart, computing densities for the Wishart and inverse
    Wishart, and computing a few auxiliary functions such as the 
    multivariate gamma and digamma functions. Many of these functions 
    are written in C to maximize efficiency.
